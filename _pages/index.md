# Introduction
“When a bullet shatters the night in New York City, who bears the cost—and where does it land first?” Every mark in the charts below is a life disrupted. Together they reveal a pattern of inequity that stretches across borough lines and calendar pages—and point to the people who feel gun violence most.

# Where Gunfire Concentrates
Every shaded block is a neighbourhood; every shade of blue is a measure of trauma. This map traces not just where shots ring out, but where fear lingers and where families grieve. Precincts in Brooklyn and the Bronx light up darkest, year after year—a haunting consistency that echoes wider divides in opportunity, policing, and public trust.

# Are NYC Neighborhoods Getting Safer?
From 2011 to 2019 New York City seemed to be winning ground: shootings fell across nearly every borough. Then came 2020. In a single year the number of incidents spiked dramatically, wiping out a decade of progress.  Brooklyn and the Bronx shouldered the heaviest burden, a reminder that safety gains remain fragile—especially in communities already hit hardest.

# Two Lines, One Story: What Happens When the Shots Ring Out

Incidents and deaths usually run in lockstep: fewer bullets, fewer funerals. Between 2006 and 2019 both measures slid downward. The 2020 spike shattered that harmony—shootings almost doubled, and deaths surged alongside them. Though fatalities have since dipped, incident counts remain far above the lows of the 2010s, keeping families on edge.

# Where Victims Are Most at Risk
Gunfire finds people where they live—and where they gather. For children, shootings cluster around bodegas and inside homes. For adults 18–44, private residences still dominate, but bars, night-clubs, and commercial storefronts rise sharply—spaces most alive after dark. For seniors, violence is rare yet overwhelmingly domestic. One location threads through every age group: the home.

# Rhythms of the Year: How Crime Ebbs and Flows Across Months and Weekdays
Plot incidents on a calendar and a weekly pulse appears. Thursdays spike all year, but especially under July’s heat. Fridays and weekends intensify the pattern—as if the city’s social calendar sets the table for violence.

# The City That Never Sleeps— When Is It Loudest?
Nightfall is New York’s most reliable drumbeat of danger. Sixty-two percent of shootings strike between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., with the peak ringing out between 9 p.m. and midnight. On Saturdays the rhythm drags even later, catching people just as they head home—or try to sleep.

# The Faces Behind the Numbers
Step back, and the bars resolve into people. The prime of life—ages 25–44—towers above other groups. Men account for the vast majority of victims, but race deepens the disparity: Black New Yorkers bear a disproportionate share of harm, a reflection of long-standing structural inequities.

# Exploring the City’s Hidden Structure
Administrative borders don’t fully explain violence. DBSCAN clustering reveals “found neighbourhoods” that share temporal rhythms, demographics, and intensities. Explore each patch: some pulse at 2 a.m., others at dusk; some skew tragically young, others deadly. The takeaway? Tailored interventions—not one-size-fits-all policing—offer the best hope.

# What the Data Demands of Us
Numbers alone won’t save lives, but they spotlight where action is urgent. Target resources to the darkest precincts, the busiest Thursdays, the midnight peaks. Support violence-interruption programmes, invest in trauma care, and lift up communities long left with the loudest nights. Data points to the hour; people decide what happens next.
