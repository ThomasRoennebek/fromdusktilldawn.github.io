# Exploring the City’s Hidden Structure
DBSCAN (Density Based Scan) reveals something traditional boundaries often obscure: how gun violence organically clusters across the city. Instead of relying on precincts or boroughs, this method uncovers found neighborhoods — areas that share temporal rhythms, demographic patterns, and spatial densities.

Use the interactive dashboard below to explore each cluster in depth. The map highlights where incidents concentrate, while the charts show when they happen and who is most affected. By toggling between clusters, you’re not just comparing locations — you’re uncovering distinct social geographies of violence that emerge from the data itself.
