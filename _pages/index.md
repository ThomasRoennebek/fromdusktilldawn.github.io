# Introduction
https://github.com/ThomasRoennebek/fromdusktilldawn.github.io/tree/master/Notebooks

Our analysis  is based on more than a decade of NYPD records, which track every confirmed shooting in New York City between 2006 and 2024.  These official reports document when and where each incident occurred, as well as, if available, information about the individuals involved.  The data, which is reviewed quarterly and made public, provides one of the clearest views of how gun violence spreads around the city.


“When a bullet shatters the night in New York City, who bears the cost—and where does it land first?” Every mark in the charts below is a life disrupted. Together they reveal a pattern of inequity that stretches across borough lines and calendar pages—and point to the people who feel gun violence most.

# Where Gunfire Concentrates
Every shaded block is a neighbourhood; every shade of blue is a measure of trauma. This map traces not just where shots ring out, but where fear lingers and where families grieve. Precincts in Brooklyn and the Bronx light up darkest, year after year—a haunting consistency that echoes wider divides in opportunity, policing, and public trust.

This map makes visible what many residents already know: gun violence in New York City doesn’t spread evenly. Instead, it clusters—often in the same precincts, year after year. The darkest shades trace a geography of repeated loss, pointing to where resources are stretched thin, and where trust in safety may feel most frayed.


# Are NYC Neighborhoods Getting Safer?
From 2011 to 2019 New York City seemed to be winning ground: shootings fell across nearly every borough. Then came 2020. In a single year the number of incidents spiked dramatically, wiping out a decade of progress. Brooklyn and the Bronx shouldered the heaviest burden, a reminder that safety gains remain fragile—especially in communities already hit hardest.

When observed year after year, the rise and fall of gun violence becomes a citywide pulse. The 2020 spike—nearly doubling citywide shootings and pushing totals to their highest in over a decade—was both statistically and emotionally significant.Brooklyn and the Bronx, already carrying the highest load, absorbed most of the surge, raising urgent questions about why safety gains don’t hold equally—and who is left most exposed when they fail [1].




# Two Lines, One Story: What Happens When the Shots Ring Out

Incidents and deaths usually run in lockstep: fewer bullets, fewer funerals. Between 2006 and 2019 both measures slid downward. The 2020 spike shattered that harmony—shootings almost doubled, and deaths surged alongside them. Though fatalities have since dipped, incident counts remain far above the lows of the 2010s, keeping families on edge.

<figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong> Annual shootings, stacked by borough. The Bronx and Brooklyn still dominate the tally</figcaption>
The growing difference between these two lines is more than just statistics; it's emotional.  In 2020, shootings nearly doubled and killings increased by 44%, marking the highest level of gun violence in more than a decade.  That year was more than just a rise; it was a rupture, driven by the pandemic's disarray, societal upheaval, and altered policing.  The high increase was also not coincidental; it struck hardest in already vulnerable Brooklyn and Bronx communities.  This figure depicts not only a numerical problem, but also a collapse in public safety [1].




# Where Victims Are Most at Risk
Gunfire finds people where they live—and where they gather. For children, shootings cluster around bodegas and inside homes. For adults 18–44, private residences still dominate, but bars, night-clubs, and commercial storefronts rise sharply—spaces most alive after dark. For seniors, violence is rare yet overwhelmingly domestic. One location threads through every age group: the home.

<figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong>Top 6 shooting locations. Private homes outpace storefronts and night-clubs, especially for the youngest victims</figcaption>
Gunfire finds people where they live—and where they gather. For children under 18, private homes account for the highest share of shootings, followed by bodegas and local grocery stores—spaces that should feel safe. Among young adults aged 18–24, the landscape shifts: while private homes remain the top setting, bars, nightclubs, and bodegas appear at nearly equal levels, showing how nightlife and social hubs become high-risk zones. For adults more broadly, bars and storefronts remain prominent, suggesting that violence often strikes in moments of social proximity, not isolation.

Across all groups, one location remains constant: home.  Whether you're a toddler, an adult, or an elderly person, the most likely spot to get shot is while sleeping.

The visualization demonstrates not only where violence occurs, but also how daily environments become locations of vulnerability.  These are not remote or unfamiliar locations; they are bedrooms, bodegas, and bars.  For policymakers, the message is critical: prevention must begin where life occurs most frequently.


# Rhythms of the Year: How Crime Ebbs and Flows Across Months and Weekdays
Plot incidences on a calendar, and a weekly pulse will appear.  Thursdays are especially popular during the hot month of July.  Fridays and weekends exacerbate the tendency, as if the city's social schedule prepares the groundwork for violence.  These cycles are remarkably durable across time, but not impervious to change.

In 2022, for instance, NYPD data showed a dramatic 30% drop in shootings in August compared to the year before—part of a broader decline that marked one of the lowest August totals in decades. Murders dropped even faster, falling more than 50% from the same month in 2021. The heatmap lets us see these gains take shape across weekdays and months, highlighting not just when violence happens, but when it begins to ease[2].


# The City That Never Sleeps— When Is It Loudest?
Nightfall is New York’s most reliable drumbeat of danger. Sixty-two percent of shootings strike between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m., with the peak ringing out between 9 p.m. and midnight. On Saturdays the rhythm drags even later, catching people just as they head home—or try to sleep.

<iframe src="{{ '/assets/images/gunfire_radial_clock.html' | relative_url }}" width="100%" height="620px" frameborder="0" title="Incident Dashboard"></iframe>
<figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong>Hour-by-hour radial chart. 62 % of shootings strike between 8 p.m. and 4 a.m.; the peak window is 9 p.m.–midnight.</figcaption>

But dig deeper, and that rhythm varies depending on the day.  On weekdays, the peak remains strong and early—still centered between 9 p.m. and midnight, but slightly less concentrated.  On weekends, the trend extends longer, with a new high between 1 and 4 a.m., and 70% of all events occurring at night.  In other words, Saturday is noisier, longer, and more dangerous.

These clock plots do more than just map time; they reveal the cultural trends that influence violence. Weeknights remain risky, but weekends are when risk spills over. For people walking home from parties, working night shifts, or simply staying out late, the risk never sleeps— it only moves forward.


# The Faces Behind the Numbers
Step back, and the bars resolve into people. The prime of life—ages 25–44—towers above other groups. Men account for the vast majority of victims, but race deepens the disparity: Black New Yorkers bear a disproportionate share of harm, a reflection of long-standing structural inequities.


<iframe src="{{ '/assets/images/victim_demographics.html' | relative_url }}" width="100%" height="520px" frameborder="0" title="Incident Dashboard"></iframe>
<figcaption><strong>Figure:</strong>Victim demographics, 2006-2024. One in three victims is aged 25-44; men and Black New Yorkers bear the heaviest burden</figcaption>
These bars put faces to numbers, exposing not only how many people are hurt, but also who they are. Men constitute over 85% of all shooting victims, with Black New Yorkers accounting for more than half of all cases. Meanwhile, young adults aged 25 to 44 stand out sharply year after year. These are more than just demographic categories; they reflect communities under constant strain, reminding us that violence and vulnerability are not uniformly dispersed.


# Exploring the City’s Hidden Structure
This dashboard lets users navigate a more organic geography of violence—one defined not by precinct lines but by lived realities. Clusters with high fatality rates differ starkly from those with late-night spikes or youth-heavy demographics. For instance, while Cluster 1 pulses through weekend midnights in South Brooklyn, Cluster 0 cuts across the Bronx and Queens with broader time coverage and a more balanced demographic profile. Other clusters, like Cluster 11, are smaller but intensely lethal.

Together, these patterns argue for smarter, more localized strategies—where public health interventions, community outreach, and policing efforts adapt to how each area actually experiences harm.

# What Comes Next
The evidence is obvious, yet clarity does not equate to change.  Every graphic represents a decision that has yet to be made—by legislators, communities, and all of us.  These maps and timelines do not simply depict where harm occurs.  They ask us, "What does it mean to meet these patterns with care rather than just reacting?"  To create calm during the most noisy hours?  The answer will not come from statistics alone, but from our willingness to listen to what the evidence makes impossible to ignore.
